# momentum-flight

Private repository for our Momentum Team for purely storage purposes to store copies of working versions of our code when we reach our milestones

No need to learn git commands for this project; use copy/paste

### To Add File ###
Go to the correct Draft folder

Click 'Add file' > 'Create new file'

Title as name-date.py

Copy paste file

Click 'Commit new file'

### Tasks ###
Goal for Progress Report: Super basic reactionary alg: if middle sensors are close to obstacle, go up. elif far, go down. else, go straight


1. middle_range_min(): given lidar reading data, look along middle sensors to find the range min

2. Code: Update while loop in reactionary code, so that it has an if elif else statement (if middle sensors are close to obstacle, go up. elif far, go down. else, go straight)

3. Numbers: convert between degrees for lat/lon and meters with approximation from tutorial. Also we currently have random numbers for how much forward or up drone should go. Can look into the units and put in more reasonable numbers later

4. Test: Run our programs on remote terminal and take a video for progress report. Do this by opening vscode and saving our files; if you save in the same location as demo_mission.py (home/Momentum etc) you can run it the same way as the Google Docs

5. Index: Check that the order of the ranges in lidar data is what we think


### To Do ###
1. Read the [Momentum Code Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/190yfrauW1Njj7F8keZMDoK98A8mNPiVudUl6i1_pmwU/edit?usp=sharing) to understand how to interact with the software in Python. You can skip page 1 

If you have questions compile them at the top of the Google Docs

2. (If time) Look at the two python files located in the folders above. I write at the top which lines are important
