# momentum-flight

Private repository for our Momentum Team for purely storage purposes to store copies of working versions of our code when we reach our milestones

No need to learn git commands for this project; use copy/paste

### To Add File ###
Go to the correct Draft folder

Click 'Add file' > 'Create new file'

Title as name-date.py

Copy paste file

Click 'Commit new file'

### To Do ###
1. Read the Momentum Code Notes Google Docs linked below. You can skip page 1 but the other pages are important to understand the pseudocode and how to interact with the software in Python.

2. Look at the two python files located in the folders above. I write at the top of the files which lines are new and not copy pasted from the LM github, ie lines 45-81.

3. If you have questions compile them at the top of the Momentum Code Notes Google Docs.
