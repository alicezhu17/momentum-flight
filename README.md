### Tasks ###
Goal: Super basic reactionary alg: if middle sensors are close to obstacle, go up. else, go straight

2. Distance pointing down: given lidar_data, use orientation to figure out which index is pointing down and this distance

3. Math for alg: currently have random numbers for how much forward or up drone should go. need to put in more reasonable numbers

3. Test: that program runs on remote terminal

### To Do ###
1. Read the [Momentum Code Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/190yfrauW1Njj7F8keZMDoK98A8mNPiVudUl6i1_pmwU/edit?usp=sharing) to understand how to interact with the software in Python. You can skip page 1 

If you have questions compile them at the top of the Google Docs

2. (If time) Look at the two python files located in the folders above. I write at the top which lines are important
